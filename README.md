# Age Verification Solution Technical Specification

## Overview
The objective is to develop an EU-wide solution to age verification that reinforces the [Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065) objective to ensure safe, secure, and trusted digital space—notably Article 28, which focuses on protecting minors—and the [Louvain-la-Neuve Declaration](https://bosa.belgium.be/sites/default/files/content/documents/LLN%20Declaration%20-%20Informal%20Telecom%20Council%20-%20v.12.04.2024.pdf ), which promotes a safer and more trustworthy online environment. The proposed solution is intended to bridge the gap until the [EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallets](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) become available by the end of 2026, enabling the incorporation of the age verification functionality in them.

Age verification plays a crucial role across various scenarios, including access to online services, purchases of age-restricted products and claiming age-related benefits. Given the regulatory priorities and societal needs, this documentation focuses on age verification for accessing online services with restricted content or services.

This repository contains the technical specifications for the Age Verification Solution, designed for extension, adoption and deployment by member states or other actors.
